## Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michal.

I am a senior full-stack developer ðŸ’» specializing in PHP (mainly WordPress and Nette Framework). I work full-remote, primarily as an external developer for digital agencies. 

Although PHP is my main focus, I'm skilled in a wide range of other technologies. When I'm not coding, I enjoy traveling, relaxing with a shisha, or (learning) skateboarding. I also like to drink some good beer or wine occasionally with my friends or colleagues.

I like minimalism and open source.
