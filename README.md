## Hey! 👋 I'm Michal.

I am a senior full-stack developer and software architect 💻 specializing in PHP (mainly WordPress and Nette Framework). I work full-remote, primarily as an external developer and IT consultant for digital agencies. 

Although 🐘 PHP is my main focus, I'm skilled in a wide range of other technologies (front-end coding, server administration, Docker, networking etc.). 

In my free time, when I'm not coding, I enjoy ✈️ traveling, relaxing with a 💨 shisha, or (learning) 🛹 skateboarding. I also like to drink some good 🍺 beer or wine occasionally with my friends or colleagues.

I like minimalism and open source.
